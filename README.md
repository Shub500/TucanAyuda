# TucánAyuda Frontend 🎨

This repository contains front-end customizations for [TucánAyuda](https://tucanayuda.com), a Spanish-language website providing college admission advice to Costa Rican students.

## ✨ Project Highlights ✨

* **Custom College Group Listings:** I created a dedicated page template to dynamically display a searchable and filterable directory of college student groups. (See `college-student-group.php` and accompanying styles).
* **Print-Friendly Functionality:**  To improve user experience, I added features to view specific content as a printable PDF or for easy printing directly from the browser.
* **Bespoke Design Elements:**  Through custom CSS and strategic theme modifications, I tailored the look and feel of the website to match Tucán Ayuda's branding and enhance user interaction.

##  🚀  About the Project  🚀

I launched TucánAyuda, focusing on empowering Costa Rican students with valuable resources during the college application journey.
